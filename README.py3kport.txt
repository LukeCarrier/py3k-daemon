This is a port of python-daemon 1.5.5 to Python 3.

It has been tested on Python 3.2, and may work on earlier 3.X as
well. Note that it relies on a paired py3k port of lockfile 0.9.1,
available at:

All modifications are in the public domain, to the maximum extent possible
given the upstream code's license.
